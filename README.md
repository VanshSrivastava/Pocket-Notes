# Pocket Notes

This is a simple Notes taking web-app named "Pocket Notes" in which a user can create and update their notes.
The software requires the user to first create a user profile
by providing personal information. The app has a search tool,
which allows the user to filter out notes that match their criteria. If a user
desires to delete a note entirely owing to its completion, they can do so
by using the "delete" functionality. 
  
Furthermore,the app allows the user to delete all
notes they have ever generated. Since this project runs on a backend, the
user can access their notes from anywhere on any device.The user can
log out of the app or the system at any time without affecting the previously stored notes. The user information is encrypted and saved in the
database, making it secure and inaccessible to others.
